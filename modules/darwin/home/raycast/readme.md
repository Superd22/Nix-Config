# Raycast
Dmenu alternative for macos

Currently everything here needs to be imported manually in raycast...
scripts/ needs to be defined as "script directory" in raycast
quicklinks needs to be imported.

## Layout
```
.
├── scripts/              # bash scripts to be created as commands in raycast
├── quicklinks.json       # Quicklinks to import to raycast
```
